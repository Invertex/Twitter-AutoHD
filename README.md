# Twitter AutoHD
-Automatically makes Twitter load the highest resolution of video or image.<br/> 
>***(even if the image isn't expanded to full view, it will be highest quality, including when saving it)***<br/>

-Media Download button on the tweet's control bar (won't work on retweets for now, go to original post first).<br/>

-Images will layout in full view automatically if possible, or show as much as possible for multi-image layouts.<br/>

-Allows click and drag of the right edge of the content feed to shrink/epxand it to your liking. (setting will auto-save for you)

-Custom context menu when right-clicking an image. This ensures a descriptive filename when saving, like this:</br>
`username - postStatusNum_imgNum.jpg`

>This ensures that your saved images always have the name of who posted the content, including the status number which you can use to get the exact tweet it was from.<br/>
>For posts with multiple images, it will also tack on the number that image was in the post.

><b>This should also greatly help with keeping your image folder organized :)</b>
