# Twitter AutoHD
Automatically makes Twitter load the highest resolution of video or image.<br/>
Also adds a download button for them on the tweet buttons bar (won't work on retweets for now, go to original post first).
Images will also layout in full view automatically if possible, or show as much as possible for multi-image layouts.
