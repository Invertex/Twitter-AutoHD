# Twitter AutoHD
-Automatically makes Twitter load the highest resolution of video or image.<br/> 
***(even if the image isn't expanded to full view, it will be highest quality, including when saving it)<br/>
-Also adds a download button for them on the tweet buttons bar (won't work on retweets for now, go to original post first).<br/>
-Images will also layout in full view automatically if possible, or show as much as possible for multi-image layouts.<br/>

A custom context menu is also made when right-clicking an image. This ensures a descriptive filename when saving, like this:</br>
`username - postStatusNum_imgNum.jpg`

This ensures that your saved images always have the name of who posted the content, including the status number you can use to get the exact tweet it was from.<br/>
For posts with multiple images, it will also tack on the number that image was in the post.

Example of video download button:<br/>
